/**
 * @mainpage Tweeny
 *
 * Tweeny is an inbetweening library designed for the creation of complex animations for games and other beautiful
 * interactive software. It leverages features of modern C++ to empower developers with an intuitive API for
 * declaring tweenings of any type of value, as long as they support arithmetic operations.
 *
 * This document contains Tweeny's API reference. The most interesting parts are:
 *
 * * The Fine @ref manual
 * * The tweeny::from global function, to start a new tween.
 * * The tweeny::tween class itself that has all the interesting methods for a tween.
 * * The <a href="modules.html">modules page</a> has a list of type of easings.
 *
 * This is how the API looks like:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * #include "tweeny.h"
 *
 * using tweeny::easing;
 *
 * int main() {
 *  // steps 1% each iteration
 *  auto tween = tweeny::from(0).to(100).during(100).via(easing::linear);
 *  while (tween.progress() < 1.0f) tween.step(0.01f);
 *
 *  // a tween with multiple values
 *  auto tween2 = tweeny::from(0, 1.0f).to(1200, 7.0f).during(1000).via(easing::backInOut, easing::linear);
 *
 *  // a tween with multiple points, different easings and durations
 *  auto tween3 = tweeny::from(0, 0)
 *                  .to(100, 100).during(100).via(easing::backOut, easing::backOut)
 *                  .to(200, 200).during(500).via(easing::linear);
 *  return 0;
 * }
 *
 * @endcode
